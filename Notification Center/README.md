1. Open the `Windows 11 Notification Center Styler` mod in Windhawk.
   - Go to the `Settings` tab and click the `Textual` button to swap into Textual mode.
   - Copy the contents of the [notification center.yml](/Notification%20Center/notification%20center.yml) file to the text box and click `Save`.
2. Open the `Shell Flyout Positions` mod in Windhawk
   - Go to the `Settings` tab and click the `Textual` button to swap into Textual mode.
   - Copy the contents of the [align with tray.yml](/Shell%20Flyout%20Positions/align%20with%20tray.yml) file to the text box and click `Save`.
