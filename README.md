# Let me say right away that I'm neither a programmer nor a designer. I simply liked this design and decided to tweak it a bit to suit my tastes. I'd be grateful for any help or advice. This is still a work in progress (I do this in my free time and whenever I feel like it)

##### Also thanks to @x3phyy for this and other improvements that I'm using

#### If you'd like to help, I'd be grateful! Below will be written the current problems that I want to solve in the future or I am unable to solve them.

  ### Problems I couldn't solve:
        Start Menu:
          1. In the "Pinned" section, there's a gray border around the folder thumbnails 
             (where the four app icon previews are)
          2. At the bottom of the "All" section, there's a border that hides the contents of 
             that section, but it's not very nicely positioned. I couldn't lower this border 
             to the "User Panel" bottom level
          3. Remove the "All" heading

        Notifications Center:
          1. Change the color of the buttons when it is off, icons and the text underneath them 
             to gray for better readability

  ### I want to try doing this in the future:
        Start Menu:
          1. When opening the Start menu, the icon in the Search Bar is blue-green, but if I 
             click on a folder or button that doesn't close the Start Menu, the color changes 
             to gray (I'd like it to be always gray)
          2. Move the "Account" button slightly to the right and the "power" button to the left 
             for symmetry
          3. Change the spacing between icons in the "Pinned" section
             
        Taskbar:
          1. Change the tray background from the standard one to WindowGlass
