# Let me say right away that I'm neither a programmer nor a designer. I simply liked this design and decided to tweak it a bit to suit my tastes. I'd be grateful for any help or advice. This is still a work in progress (I do this in my free time and whenever I feel like it)

##### Also thanks to @x3phyy for this and other improvements that I'm using

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This theme ONLY supports 1920x1080 and 1920x1200 screen reolutions with a DPI of 100%. Using it on anything else will result in overlapping elements.


#### If you'd like to help, I'd be grateful! Below will be written the current problems that I want to solve in the future or I am unable to solve them. You can find a changelog with all of our current changes [here](/CHANGELOG.md).

### Problems I couldn't solve:
      Start Menu:
        1. In the "Pinned" section, there's a gray border around the folder thumbnails 
           (where the four app icon previews are)
        2. At the bottom of the "All" section, there's a border that hides the contents of 
           that section, but it's not very nicely positioned. I couldn't lower this border 
           to the "User Panel" bottom level

      Notifications Center:
        1. Change the color of the buttons when it is off, icons and the text underneath them 
            to gray for better  readability

### I want to try doing this in the future:
      Start Menu:
        1. When opening the Start menu, the icon in the Search Bar is blue-green, but if I 
           click on a folder or button that doesn't close the Start Menu, the color changes 
           to gray (I'd like it to be always gray)
        2. Move the "Account" button slightly to the right and the "power" button to the left 
           for symmetry
        3. Change the spacing between icons in the "Pinned" section
             
      Taskbar:
        1. Change the tray background from the standard one to WindowGlass
