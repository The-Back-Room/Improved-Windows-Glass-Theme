> [!IMPORTANT]
> The start menu theme ONLY supports 16:9 or 16:10 screen reolutions with a DPI of 100% *(Tested on 1920x1080 and 1920x1200)*. Using it on anything else will result in overlapping elements. There is a minimal variation included of which *should* support most resolutions regardless of DPI.
