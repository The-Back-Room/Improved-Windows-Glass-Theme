# To-Do
A list of planned tweaks, fixes and/or changes. These changes are NOT final and may be updated or swapped out over time.
For now these are simply a guideling of things I would *like* to do if possible. Some of these may not be possible with the current capabilities.

## Start Menu

- Adjust the start menu scroll container size for more consistant visuals.
- Adjust list view width to remove overlapping on hover.
- Adjust grid view width to allow for more columns and better fit the available space.
             
## Taskbar

- Add seperate start button images for each start button state. Preferably a transparent frosted glass version of the default Windows 11 start button to match the glass ui a bit more. For now, these are on hold until a method of adding a seperate image per state is properly fleshed out.
   - **Normal State**: A frosted glass version of the default Windows 11 start button's normal image.
   - **Pointer Over State**: A frosted glass version of the default Windows 11 start button's pointer over image.
   - **Pressed State**: A frosted glass version of the default Windows 11 start button's pressed image. 

## File Explorer

- Adjust the transparency of the overflow menus for improved visibility. *(Currently doesn't respect the blur settings at all; Possibly a XML issue in the mod itself)*
- Adjust the transparency of the tooltips on the toolbars for improved visibility. *(Currently doesn't respect the blur settings at all; Possibly a XML issue in the mod itself)*
- Fix the overlap bug in the Home and Gallery tabs. *(Triggers when swapping from a new tab or when the Home tab is set as the startup page; Possibly a XML issue in the mod itself)*
